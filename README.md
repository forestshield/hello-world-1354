# hello-world-1354
The very first test repository.
It has several test projects in the "PROJECTS" directory.
It might have some compilation errors, when used on system others then Mac osx,
due to some path's absolute names.
It will be fixed soo.

------------
N.B. Exersises from the Haskell book
at "hello-world-1354/Haskell/CODE/haskell-book-master/..."
taken from Martín Valdés de León git 
"https://github.com/mvaldesdeleon/haskell-book/blob/master/ch02/exercises.md"
Many Thanks for that

-------------
N.B. file ghci.conf goes to this directory ~./ghc  
It sets ghci prompt to red and Lambda.   (at least it works on MacOS)

IMPORTANT !!!
-- N.B. !!! To print properly Unocode strings on Windows PowerShell and avoid console eception
-- "*** Exception: <stdout>: hPutChar: invalid argument (invalid character)"
-- type "chcp 65001" in powershell before using ghci !!!
