# hello-world-1354
The very first test repository.
It has several test projects in the "PROJECTS" directory.
It might have some compilation errors, when used on system others then Mac osx,
due to some path's absolute names.
It will be fixed soo.

Many Thanks for that

file ghci.conf goes to this directory ~./ghc  
It sets ghci prompt to red and Lambda.   (at least it works on MacOS)
