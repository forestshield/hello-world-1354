# hello-world-1354
The very first test repository.
It has several test projects in the "PROJECTS" directory.

The project L4 is multiplatform and working fine on 3 tested systems:
MacOSX 10.11, Window 10, Linux Ubunu 20.04
VSCode was used on all 3 platforms
-- N.B. !!! To print properly Unocode strings on Windows PowerShell and avoid console exception
-- "*** Exception: <stdout>: hPutChar: invalid argument (invalid character)"
-- type "chcp 65001" in powershell before using ghci !!!
-- use ConEmu on Windows, "https://www.fosshub.com/ConEmu.html"

------------
N.B. Exersises from the Haskell book
at "hello-world-1354/Haskell/CODE/haskell-book-master/..."
taken from Martín Valdés de León git 
"https://github.com/mvaldesdeleon/haskell-book/blob/master/ch02/exercises.md"
Many Thanks for that

-------------
N.B. file ghci.conf goes to this directory ~./ghc  
It sets ghci prompt to red and Lambda.   (at least it works on MacOS)

-------------
N.B. Subdirectory L4/RUN has all the files, needed to run executable L4-exe.
Replace L4-exe with newly built.
